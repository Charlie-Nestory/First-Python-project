The post office charges parcel-senders according to the weight of their parcel. For a parcel weighing 2 kilograms or less the charge is R125. For each kilogram or part of a kilogram above 2 there is an additional charge of R55. Write a program which inputs the weight of a parcel and outputs the amount the sender is charged.
